Data cleaning & scrubbing: 

Before we used the dataset, some changes were made. First, we added a new column titled 'Total' which is the sum of each fuel type within 
that country. Next, we added replaced the spaces with underscores in each column name. 

When imported into Tableau, our dataset had over 10,000 rows with some being redudant data. We, therefore, used the filter method to keep rows 
ranging from the years 1750-2020 and 2010-2020. We also removed grouped up nations (for example Asia and Europe). 




Findings and Insights: 

  1. Which countries have the highest CO2 emissions? 

We applied a filter to only showcase top 10 countries with the highest CO2 emissions and in the year range of 2010-2020. 
We found that China, the United States, and India were the top 3 CO2 producers. If we were to change our year range to 2000-2010, 
the United States was actually in the lead. From here, we can make predictions as to why the leading producer changed over the years. (Figure 1). 

We chose to select a year range from 2010-2020; however, we can also choose individual years by changing our filter type. We made 
this chart interactive by adding a 'year' sliding filter on the side. (Figure 2). 

  2. Which sources contribute the most CO2 in the United States? 

Our second research question is to focus solely on the United States in the years 2010-2020 to see the changes over the years. We found that 
the top 3 fuel types produced from 2010 - 2020 were Coal, Oil, and Gas and has reamined constant since 2015. This is to be expected 
since we know these three are main fuel types around the world. Though it has fluctated at some times perhaps due to some companies 
switching to sustainability, it is without a doubt still consistent. (Figure 2). 

  3. What are the impacts of CO2 emissions on our economy, society, and environment? 

For this question, we did outside research on the impacts of CO2 emissions on our economy, society, and environment if countries
continue to emit large amounts of CO2 into our atmosphere. 

From my own personal questions 

  4. Which fuel type do countries emit the most? Who are the top 10 producers for that source?  

For this question, I created my own chart to answer my question. From previous charts, I found that Coal was the largest fuel type 
produced by countries. From there, I filtered out the top 10 countries from Coal production in 2020 and found that the top 3 were China, the United States, 
and Russia. The results are not any different from our previous findings; however, we see Africa and Poland on our new list. This tells us that 
though Africa and Poland weren't the top 10 general largest CO2 producers, they are producing large amounts of CO2 compared to other fuel types. (Figure 3).
