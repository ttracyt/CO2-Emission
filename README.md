# CO2-Emission Dashboard

## About this project: 

Our objective for this assignmnet was to choose a global problem, collect datasets, and present our findings on Tabelau through dashboards. After we completed our project, I personally went beyond and made some changes and created new charts. 

My team members and I (a group of 3) chose 'Climate Change' as our topic, specifically focusing on the emission of Carbon Dixodie around the world. We chose climate change because our world is currently being affected by the effects of climate change such as the rising temperatures and melting glaciers. 

We will be using datasets we collected to provide insights on which countries were the largest producers of CO2 and by what fuel type (source). With our findings, we will 

## Business Questions: 

There are a total of 3 questions we hope to answer once we have our findings. 
  1. Which countries have the highest CO2 emissions? 
  2. Which sources contribute the most CO2 in the United States? 
  3. What are the impacts of CO2 emissions on our economy, society, and environment? 
  
 
### Personal Questions: 
  4. Which fuel type do countries emit the most? 


## Dataset we used & cleaning the dataset: 

The dataset we used is titled, "CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissons", by Hannah Ritchie, Max Roser, and Pablo Rosado.
