# CO2-Emission

About this project: 

Our objective for this assignmnet was to choose a global problem, collect datasets, and present our findings on Tabelau through dashboards. 

My team members and I (a group of 3) chose 'Climate Change' as our topic, specifically focusing on the emission of Carbon Dixodie around the world. We chose climate change because our world is currently being affected by the effects of climate change such as the rising temperatures and melting glaciers. 

We will be using datasets we collected to provide insights on which countries were the largest producers of CO2 and by what fuel type (source). With our findings, we will 

Business Questions: 

There are a total of 3 questions we hope to answer once we have our findings. 
  1. Which countries have the highest CO2 emissions? 
  2. Which sources contribute the most CO2 in the United States? 
  3. What are the impacts of CO2 emissions on our economy, society, and environment? 


Dataset we used & cleaning the dataset: 

The dataset we used is titled, "CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissons", by Hannah Ritchie, Max Roser, and Pablo Rosado.

Data cleaning & scrubbing: 

Before we used the dataset, some changes were made. First, we added a new column titled 'Total' which is the sum of each fuel type within that country. Next, we added replaced the spaces with underscores in each column name. 

When imported into Tableau, our dataset had over 10,000 rows with some being redudant data. We, therefore, used the filter method to keep rows ranging from the years 1750-2020 and 2010-2020. We also removed grouped up nations (for example Asia and Europe). 



Findings and Insights: 

  1. Which countries have the highest CO2 emissions? 

We applied a filter to only showcase top 10 countries with the highest CO2 emissions and in the year range of 2010-2020. We found that China, United States, and India were the top 3 CO2 producers. If we were to change oour year range to 2000-2010, United States was actually in the lead. From here, we can make predictions as to why the leading producer changed over the years.
